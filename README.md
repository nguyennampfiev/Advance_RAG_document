# RAG Applications for Chatting with All Formats of Files
## This repository demonstrates a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for interacting with various types of document files using LLMs (Large Language Models). The solution is built using Grok for LLM calls and Unstructured IO for data processing, with an interactive demo showcased through Gradio.

### Key Features
Flexible File Support: Supports multiple file formats including PDF, DOCX, TXT, and more.
LLM Integration: Utilizes the capabilities of Grok for calling and managing LLMs.
Data Processing: Leverages Unstructured IO for seamless data parsing and extraction.
Interactive UI: Powered by Gradio for a user-friendly chat interface.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Incorporates document retrieval to enhance LLM responses with specific contextual information.
